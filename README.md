# Growth mindset
**Growth mindset is allowing your brain to gain knowledge and learn new skills that can create new talents by sheer will.**
## How to keep a growth mindset
- *look for new ways to think about the problem*
- *Ask myself two question, 1. what was the best part of my day? 2. what went wrong and how can I make sure it doesn't happen again?*
- *Remember that short-term frustration will likely result in long-term improvement of my abilities.*
