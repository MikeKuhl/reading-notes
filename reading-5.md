# Design web pages with CSS #
## CSS, what is it?
- *CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets*
- *CSS is what gives your page its makeover*
- *"CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page."*
- *As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules.*
